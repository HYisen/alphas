# alphas

## Prelude
When I face difficulty in project naming, I would use greek alphabet.

Now that you know I have a project with [Eta](https://github.com/HYisen/Eta0) the name.
It's reasonable to guess that there are projects with name alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon, zeta in previous.
And there are their limbs.

alpha is the name I would use for demo projects or exercise solutions in the very beginning during a language learning.

Since 2013, I've learnt programming language such as C, ASM, C++, Java, ECMAScript, C#, Python, Go, bash, PowerShell.
Some little while others a lot. Because I start to use git later, many early projects only exists in my disks.
Now I decide to upload them. Mainly for archive purpose, which means a backup for the day I lost my local data.

## Rules
- Any project that existed in other repositories would not appear there.
- Projects are grouped by their major language, then name.
- Documents are optional.
- Commits may be larger there.
- I made the repository for me, not for you.
